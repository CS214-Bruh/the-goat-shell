# My Shell

## Shell Requirements
- Our shell must support 2 modes, *interactive* and *batch*.
  - **Interactive mode** supports inputs from StdIn and has a start and end message.
  - *Batch Mode* runs almost like a executable.
- Change between different directories.
  - Read the contents of the directory of course.
- Spawn child processes and obtain their exit statuses.
- Process one command per line.
- *Redirections* and *Pipelines*
  - `>`, `|`
- `cd`, `pwd`, `which`, and `exit` commands need to be implemented.
- Handle wildcards. (`*`)
